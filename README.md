**How to convert a GitHub link to a raw image link step-by-step:**

1.Start with the Original Link:
Your original link is:
https://github.com/Edusharks/Microbit-Basics-Resource/blob/main/project9%3APiano/Piano.gif

2.Identify the Components:
The important part of the URL is github.com. When you want the raw file, you need to switch from github.com to raw.githubusercontent.com.

3.Modify the URL:
Replace github.com with raw.githubusercontent.com.
Remove /blob from the path. The /blob part is only for viewing files on GitHub.

4.Resulting URL:
After making those changes, the modified link will look like this:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Edusharks/Microbit-Basics-Resource/main/project9%3APiano/Piano.gif

5.Using the Raw URL:
You can now use this raw URL in your Markdown to embed the image.
